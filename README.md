# MyCalorieCounter
MyCalorieCounter is a web application hosted on Azure, that allows individuals to upload images of their food, to determine the calorie count of the image. The web application utilizes Azure's Computer Vision API to analyze the image, based on AI trained models, to determine the pieces of food that is contained in that image, and then based on a database of known food and their corresponding calorie count, we generate the total calorie count of that image.
